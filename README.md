# Formulate

Rails form builder with flexible markup and styles.

Formulate consists of a custom form builder, which builds on top of the default
form builder in Rails, and a Sass stylesheet to provide some level of stylistic
normalization.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem 'formulate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install formulate


## Usage

The form builder will be used automatically whenever the `#form_for` helper is
called, so you don't need to do anything special to start using its methods. It
also doesn't clobber any of the built-in form builder methods, so your forms
should continue to work without modification, giving you the ability to
selectively begin using Formulate in your applications where you see fit.


## Styles

If you'd like to use Formulate's stylesheet, you'll need to import it into a
Sass file like `app/assets/stylesheets/forms.css.sass`:

``` sass
@import formulate
```

Formulate's styles are all scoped under the selector `form.formulate`, so they
shouldn't clobber anything in your own applications. Basically, this just loads
a stripped down version of [normalize.css] with only the parts relevant to
forms. It also specifies a handful of styles to improve the vertical rhythm of
the elements generated by the form builder.
